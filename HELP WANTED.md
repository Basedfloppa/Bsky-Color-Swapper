# Help & Maintenance Notice

Due to somewhat frequent changes to colors used on **bsky.app** â€” and an occasionally inconsistent or unreasonable color palette â€” this extension sometimes breaks.  

If **you** or **someone you know** would like to help maintain the project, your contribution would be greatly appreciated.

You can start by looking at the first three variables in:  
ðŸ”— [swap_pallet.js](https://github.com/Basedfloppa/Bsky-Color-Swapper/blob/main/extention/content_scripts/swap_pallet.js)

### How You Can Help
- Review and organize the color variables.  
- Remove any unnecessary or redundant colors.  
- Add any missing colors to keep the palette consistent with the latest Bluesky Web changes.

Your help will make the extension more stable and reliable for everyone.  
Thank you! ðŸ’™
