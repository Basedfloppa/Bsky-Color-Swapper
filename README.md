There is no link for Chrome as I am not able to pay the registration fee right now, so here link on how to add this extention manually: https://certera.com/kb/how-to-manually-install-a-chrome-extension-in-2-ways/

If you have any questions or additions you would like me to make, feel free to create issue on GitHub or message me on BlueSky at [@catinvoid.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/catinvoid.bsky.social)
